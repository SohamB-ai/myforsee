# Forsee AI - Predictive Intelligence System

Forsee AI is an advanced enterprise predictive intelligence operating system designed for industrial assets. It transforms maintenance from a reactive cost into a predictive advantage by identifying early degradation signals and predicting failures before they occur.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Early Degradation Detection**: Identify subtle precursor signals invisible to traditional threshold-based systems.
- **RUL Prediction**: Accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of critical components.
- **Explainable AI**: Every prediction is backed by contributing sensor data and clear reasoning.
- **Simulation Engine**: Simulate future scenarios to understand the impact of different operational loads.
- **Maintenance Recommendations**: Receive optimal action plans to prevent downtime and optimize asset life.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), AsyncIO
- **Intelligence**: PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Custom LSTM Models
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Containerized Orchestration
